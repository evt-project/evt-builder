## EVT 1.3 - RELEASE NOTES ##
#############################

* Added support for Chronological index for multiple <text>s edition. Information about date must be encoded in the <front> in a <date> element in a <docDate>; the date value must be encoded with a @when attribute:
```
	<front>
		<!-- [...] -->
		<docDate xml:id="CI_docDate">
			<date when="1212-04-02">1212 aprile 2</date>
		</docDate>
		<!-- [...] -->
	</front>
```

* Added support for translation level. 
  * Translation is available at document level, so no translations for single pages for now. 
  * Translation will be handled as additional edition level, thus in order to activate it, you must add ```<edition>Translation</edition>``` in the ```$edition_array``` variable of configuration file at the third position;
  * In the XML, the translation text must be encoded in the ```<back>``` of the ```<text>``` which it is referring to, in a ```<div type="translation">``` element (NB: the value of ```@type``` can also be ```"transl"```).

* Added support for prose/verse visualization for poetry. In order to activate it, set to ```true()``` the variable ```$prose_verses_toggler``` in the configuration file.

## EXAMPLES ##
##############

* With this release we provide three different examples. The first one is the one that has already been transformed. If you want to have a look at the other examples you have to rename the corresponding configuration file as "evt_builder-config.xsl" and perfom a new transformation of the XML source file, following the instruction contained in the documentation.
(NB: remember to add a "_default" suffix to the current configuration file, in order to avoid losing the default configurations!).
